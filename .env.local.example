# ClawCRM Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in values as needed.

# No environment variables are required!
# ClawCRM works out of the box with the built-in fallback LLM (keyword extraction + TF-IDF).
# Configure API keys in the Settings page if you want to use OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini.

# Optional: Pre-configure an API key via environment (overridden by Settings page)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
